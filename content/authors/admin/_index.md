Hi, I'm a Senior Data Scientist/ML Engineer with a firm grounding in statistics and computer science from the University of Waterloo and Georgia Institute of Technology. I have a track record of operating at the intersection of people, business, engineering and science - collaborating with cross-functional teams to design and build high-performance ML systems.

My expertise lies in translating complex business challenges into scalable, data-driven, science-backed solutions that drive measurable business impact and operational efficiency. I specialize in developing machine learning solutions across critical domains including Trust & Safety, fraud detection, content moderation, browser security, search/ranking and financial services.

I'm passionate about building robust ML systems that serve hundreds of millions of users with high availability, leveraging advanced techniques in NLP, search/ranking, distributed systems, and applied mathematics.
