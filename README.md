**Hieu Quoc Nguyen's** academic and professional portfolio website built with Hugo Academic Theme. This site showcases my journey as a Full Stack Data Scientist with expertise in machine learning, deep learning, and data engineering.

**Live Site**: [hieufromwaterloo.ca](https://hieufromwaterloo.ca/) or [hieufromwaterloo.netlify.app](https://hieufromwaterloo.netlify.app/)

## Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

#### 1. Install Hugo Extended

Hugo Extended is required for SCSS processing and the Academic theme.

**For Windows (WSL/Linux):**
```bash
# Download Hugo Extended v0.119.0 (same version as production)
wget https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.119.0/hugo_extended_0.119.0_linux-amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i hugo_extended_0.119.0_linux-amd64.deb
rm hugo_extended_0.119.0_linux-amd64.deb

# Verify installation
hugo version
```

**For macOS:**
```bash
brew install hugo
```

**For Windows (Chocolatey):**
```bash
choco install hugo-extended
```

#### 2. Install Go

Go is required for Hugo modules to work properly.

**For Linux/WSL:**
```bash
# Download and install Go
wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
rm go1.21.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz

# Add to PATH (add this to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin

# Verify installation
go version
```

**For macOS:**
```bash
brew install go
```

### Building the Site

```bash
# Start server with draft content
hugo server -D

# Or bind to all interfaces (useful for WSL)
hugo server -D --bind 0.0.0.0 --port 1313
```

4. **Access your site:**
